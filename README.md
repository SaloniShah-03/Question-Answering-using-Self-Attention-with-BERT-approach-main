# Question-Answering-using-Self-Attention-with-BERT-approach-main
-> Developed a question answering system which can retrieve direct answer in response to a submitted query, rather than a set of references that may contain the answers.
-> This was carried out by producing a set of candidate answers from the generated passages and then ranking the answers using some scoring functions which were done using RNN based LSTM network and BERT framework.
